+## Railway MCP Integration
+
+Railway MCP server is configured for direct access to Railway deployment logs and management through Claude Code.
+
+### Setup (Already Configured)
+
+The Railway MCP server is already set up in this project:
+
+```bash
+# View configured MCP servers
+claude mcp list
+
+# Check Railway MCP configuration
+claude mcp get railway
+```
+
+### Available Railway Tools
+
+Through MCP integration, you can:
+
+- **View deployment logs**: Access real-time and historical deployment logs
+- **List projects and services**: Get overview of Railway infrastructure
+- **Restart deployments**: Manage service restarts and redeployments
+- **Manage environment variables**: Update service configuration
+- **Monitor service health**: Check deployment status and metrics
+
+### Railway Configuration
+
+- **API Token**: Configured from `.env.dev` file
+- **Deployment URLs**:
+  - Production: `https://tunemeld-production.up.railway.app/`
+  - Legacy: `https://l4drieh8.up.railway.app/`
+- **Docker Configuration**: Located in `django_backend/Dockerfile`
+- **Railway Config**: See `railway.json` for build settings
+
+### Quick Railway Commands
+
+```bash
+# Check Railway CLI status
+railway status
+
+# View Railway projects (requires login)
+railway list
+
+# Access logs via MCP (available through Claude tools)
+# Use Railway MCP tools instead of direct CLI when authenticated
+```
+
+**Note**: Railway MCP provides better integration than Railway CLI for automated monitoring and management through Claude Code.
