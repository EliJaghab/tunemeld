"""
Phase 4: Hydrate Tracks with ISRC Resolution and Create Canonical Records

WHAT THIS DOES:
Takes the clean structured track data from Phase 3 and resolves ISRCs to create
canonical Track objects. This is where track deduplication happens - tracks with
the same ISRC across different services are merged into one canonical Track.

INPUT:
- PlaylistTrack records from Phase 3 (normalized playlist track table)
- ISRC data stored directly in PlaylistTrack.isrc field

OUTPUT:
- Canonical Track records (one per unique ISRC)
- TrackData records (service-specific metadata linked to canonical tracks)

ISRC RESOLUTION:
- Spotify: Directly from external_ids.isrc field
- SoundCloud: Directly from publisher.isrc field
- Apple Music: Requires Spotify API lookup (track_name + artist_name â†’ ISRC)

DEDUPLICATION LOGIC:
If "Flowers" by "Miley Cyrus" appears on both Spotify and SoundCloud with
ISRC "USSM12301546", this creates:
- 1 canonical Track with ISRC "USSM12301546"
- 2 TrackData records (one for Spotify metadata, one for SoundCloud metadata)

GRACEFUL HANDLING:
- Tracks without ISRCs are logged and skipped
- Apple Music tracks without Spotify matches are skipped (for now)
